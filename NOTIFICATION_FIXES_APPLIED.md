# üîß Notification System Fixes Applied

## Problem Summary
Push notifications were working on the device but not appearing in the notifications fragment due to data flow mismatches between FCM (user-based) and UI (team-based) queries.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **NotificationService.kt** - FCM Service Fixes
- **Added team ID support**: FCM notifications now include `teamId` from message data or user's team
- **Added UserRepository injection**: To get user's team ID when not provided in FCM data
- **Added helper method**: `getCurrentUserTeamId()` to retrieve team ID from local database
- **Fixed notification creation**: Now properly sets both `userId` and `teamId`

### 2. **NotificationsViewModel.kt** - Data Loading Fixes
- **Combined data sources**: Now loads both team-based and user-based notifications
- **Added deduplication**: Removes duplicate notifications when combining sources
- **Added real-time updates**: Observes `LocalNotificationService` for immediate updates
- **Improved logging**: Better debugging information for notification counts

### 3. **CombinedNotificationRepository.kt** - Sync Fixes
- **Fixed sync method**: No longer deletes all notifications before sync
- **Added team support**: Syncs both user and team notifications
- **Added UserRepository injection**: To get user's team ID during sync
- **Improved data integrity**: Preserves existing notifications during sync

### 4. **NotificationsActivity.kt** - Testing Improvements
- **Enhanced test button**: Now creates local notifications for immediate testing
- **Better error handling**: More informative error messages
- **Simplified testing**: Direct notification creation without external services

## üîÑ Data Flow After Fixes

```
FCM Message ‚Üí NotificationService ‚Üí Local Database (with teamId)
                    ‚Üì
            NotificationsViewModel ‚Üê Repository (team + user queries)
                    ‚Üì
            NotificationsActivity ‚Üí UI Display
```

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### 1. **Test Local Notifications**
1. Open the app and navigate to Notifications
2. Tap the test button (if available in UI)
3. Verify notification appears immediately in the list

### 2. **Test FCM Notifications**
Send FCM message with team ID:
```json
{
  "to": "USER_FCM_TOKEN",
  "data": {
    "title": "Test FCM Notification",
    "body": "This should appear in the fragment",
    "type": "ANNOUNCEMENT",
    "priority": "NORMAL",
    "teamId": "TEAM_ID_HERE"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Test Real-time Updates**
1. Create a notification programmatically
2. Verify it appears immediately without refresh
3. Check that updates are reflected in real-time

## üìä Expected Results

- ‚úÖ **FCM notifications** now appear in the notifications fragment
- ‚úÖ **Team-based queries** work correctly with proper team ID
- ‚úÖ **User-specific notifications** are preserved and displayed
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates** show new notifications immediately
- ‚úÖ **Sync operations** maintain data integrity
- ‚úÖ **Deduplication** prevents duplicate notifications

## üîç Key Changes Made

1. **Data Consistency**: FCM notifications now include team ID
2. **Query Strategy**: ViewModel queries both team and user notifications
3. **Real-time Updates**: Added observation of local notification service
4. **Sync Improvements**: Better handling of notification synchronization
5. **Testing Support**: Enhanced test functionality for verification

## üéØ Resolution Status

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Notification system should now work correctly

The root cause was a mismatch between how FCM stored notifications (user-based) and how the UI queried them (team-based). The fixes ensure both data sources are properly connected and queried together.

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** using the test button in NotificationsActivity
2. **Send FCM messages** with team ID to verify end-to-end functionality
3. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Verify real-time updates** work as expected

The notification system should now properly display both push notifications and local notifications in the fragment.
